      2. Ocean of Faith
Beneath the sky so vast and blue,
Lies an ocean, deep and true,
Its waves, they whisper tales of old,
Of faith and love, pure and bold.

In every drop, a sign is found,
Of Allah's grace, both clear and profound,
The ebb and flow, the rise and fall,
A reminder that He's above it all.

When storms arise and skies turn gray,
In Allah's wisdom, trust and stay,
For every wave that seems too high,
Is tempered by His watchful eye.

With each sunrise, new hopes are born,
In His mercy, we are reborn,
An ocean of faith, forever grand,
Held in the palm of His guiding hand.
