### 4. The Path of Faith

Upon the path where shadows lay,
In moments dark and skies of gray,
A beacon shines, a guiding star,
Belief in Allah, near and far.

Through winding roads and valleys deep,
His promises, our hearts will keep,
In whispered prayers and silent cries,
His mercy soars beyond the skies.

With each new dawn, a chance to see,
The wonders of His majesty,
In every trial, His lessons bloom,
A faith that lights the darkest room.

In deeds of kindness, acts of grace,
His presence fills the empty space,
With steadfast hearts, we journey on,
Towards His light, where we belong.

Through every hardship, joy, and pain,
His love, our constant, will remain,
On paths unknown, our trust is placed,
In Allah's wisdom, we're embraced.
