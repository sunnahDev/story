1. The Light Within
In the quiet of the dawn's first light,
A whisper of faith begins to ignite,
A heart that seeks, a soul that yearns,
For the truth in every lesson learned.

With eyes that see beyond the veil,
In prayers whispered, in hopes so frail,
A strength emerges, firm and bright,
Guided by Allah's eternal light.

Each step in life, each breath we take,
A testament to the faith we make,
In shadows deep, in sunshine clear,
Belief in Him dispels all fear.

Through trials faced and mountains climbed,
His mercy endless, love refined,
In every heartbeat, every sigh,
His presence near, His truth on high.
