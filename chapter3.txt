       3. The Garden of Belief
In the garden where the lilies bloom,
Amidst the air of sweet perfume,
There lies a faith, so deeply sown,
In hearts where Allah's love has grown.

Each petal soft, each leaf so green,
Reflects a beauty, pure and serene,
In nature's book, His signs we read,
A testament to every creed.

The night may fall, the stars may gleam,
In every breath, in every dream,
His presence felt, a soothing balm,
A soul's retreat, a heart's calm.

Through seasons change and time's embrace,
His wisdom guides us, filled with grace,
In gardens lush, where believers tread,
Allah's love, forever spread.
